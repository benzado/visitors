WELCOME TO VISITORS 0.7
-----------------------

Hello, this is Visitors,
a fast and easy to use web log analyzer.

For more usage information, documentation and examples
please visit:

  http://www.hping.org/visitors

or check the docs.html file in this directory
for the reference documentation.

HOW TO COMPILE
--------------

Under UNIX systems just type:

% make

Under WIN32 you need MINGW and MSYS, then follow the above
istructions.

For compliation problems please write an email to <antirez@invece.org>
with the exact problem, version of Visitors, environment, GCC used, and so
on.

HOW TO USE WITH IIS LOGS
------------------------

Use the iis2apache.pl perl script to do the conversion, like:

cat yourIISLogFile.txt | perl iis2apache.pl > yourConvertedFile.txt

Then run visitors against "yourConvertedFile.txt".

There is an alternative way to convert logs using a program
that does not require Perl, with Windows and Linux binaries.
This program is called RConvLog and it's possible to
download it at http://www.rebex.net/RConvLog/

HOW TO GET SCREEN RESOLUTION INFORMATION
----------------------------------------

Log files don't contain information about the screen resolution
so in order to generate the screen resolution report Visitors needs
that you add the following code in your home page, after the <body>
tag:

<script>
document.write("<div style=\"visiblity:hidden;display:none;\"><img src=\"visitors-screen-res-check.jpg?"+screen.width+"x"+screen.height+"x"+screen.colorDepth+"\" /></div>");
</script>

Without this code the screen resolution report will not work.

HOW TO HELP
-----------

Unfortunately I can't accept source code written by external contributors
without a "Copyright Assignment", because I'm not sure I'll take the
GPL license in the future, instead I may switch to BSD, or even to create
a commercial version of Visitors (very unlikely). Because I don't like
the idea of "Copyright Assignment" at all I'll be happy to implement
any useful feature in Visitors for you so: Please send suggestions
and bug reports. Thank you.

ABOUT THE GPL, AND WHY SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT WORK
-------------------------------------------------

There is some kind of problem with the GPL and small projects, when
you can expect an amount of help by external contributors that is so
little that's not worth the "License Lock-In" problem. What I mean
is that Visitors is under the GPL license, and I'm not sure I'll be
happy with this license forever. For example I may want to change
the license using the BSD in the future, it's worth to lost the
ability to do it just to accept some patch?

When it's a big project and it is very likely to get a lot of contribs
all is ok, I start directly with the BSD license. An example of this
is the "Jim Interpreter", an open source program I started to develop
after Visitors itself (see http://jim.berlios.de). You get a lot of help,
the project gets bigger/better, still if you want you can use the
code for your commercial stuff (it's BSD), and everybody can do it.

Also note that nor the GPL accepting patches, nor the BSD allow
the open source developer to create software that is available in
two flawours: one free, and one commercial. BSD allows this but
everybody can create another commercial product based on the same
code: not fair. GPL allows this if you don't accept patches, that's
also not good given that after all the code contributed will stay
anyway in the GPL product forever.

This is why I don't accept patches for Visitors, and why I'm highly
unhappy with this solution. If you have some idea or comment please
feel free to send it to antirez (at) gmail (dot) org.
